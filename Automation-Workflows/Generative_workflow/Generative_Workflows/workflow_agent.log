GitHub is a platform for version control and collaboration, allowing multiple people to work on projects simultaneously. Here are some basic steps to get started:

1. **Create a Repository**: This is where your project files will be stored. You can create a new repository on GitHub by clicking the "New" button on your GitHub homepage.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Use Git to clone the repository to your local machine. This allows you to work on the files locally.

3. **Make Changes**: Edit the files on your local machine. You can use any text editor or IDE for this.

4. **Commit Changes**: After making changes, commit them to your local repository using Git. This records your changes.

5. **Push Changes**: Push your committed changes to the GitHub repository. This updates the repository with your changes.

6. **Pull Requests**: If you're collaborating with others, you can create a pull request to propose changes to the repository. This allows others to review and discuss your changes before merging them.

7. **Branching**: Use branches to work on different features or fixes independently. This helps in managing changes without affecting the main codebase.

If you have specific questions or need help with a particular aspect of GitHub, please let me know!

2025-03-20 20:49:06,666 - INFO - Unclear intent response: To create a workflow that triggers on a Jira issue and updates GitHub or Bitbucket based on a condition, you can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Trigger**: Set up a trigger in your workflow that activates when a specific event occurs in Jira, such as the creation or update of an issue.

2. **Define the Condition**: Determine the condition under which the workflow should update GitHub or Bitbucket. This could be based on issue status, priority, or any custom field in Jira.

3. **Choose the Action**: Depending on the condition, decide whether to update GitHub or Bitbucket. For GitHub, you might want to create or update an issue, a pull request, or a repository. For Bitbucket, similar actions can be taken.

4. **Implement the Workflow**:
   - If using a workflow automation tool, configure the trigger, condition, and actions within the tool.
   - If coding the workflow, use APIs to interact with Jira, GitHub, and Bitbucket. For example, use Jira's REST API to listen for issue events and GitHub's or Bitbucket's REST API to perform updates.

5. **Test the Workflow**: Before deploying, test the workflow to ensure it behaves as expected under different scenarios.

6. **Deploy and Monitor**: Once tested, deploy the workflow and monitor it for any issues or necessary adjustments.

If you have a specific provider in mind or need further assistance with the implementation, feel free to ask!

2025-03-20 20:53:06,824 - INFO - Unclear intent response: It looks like you want to add Azure DevOps (ADO) to your workflow. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Add ADO to Existing Workflow**: You can extend your current workflow by adding a new action for Azure DevOps. For example, you could add an action to update a work item in ADO. Here's a basic structure you might consider:
   ```json
   {
     "name": "update-ado",
     "type": "SCM_ACTION",
     "version": "1.0",
     "properties": {
       "project": "to_be_specified",
       "work_item_type": "to_be_specified",
       "update_type": "to_be_specified"
     },
     "metadata": {
       "title": "Update Azure DevOps",
       "connector": {
         "name": "Azure DevOps",
         "id": "ado-connector",
         "version": "1.0"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Create a New Workflow with ADO**: If you prefer to start a new workflow, you can define a trigger and actions specific to Azure DevOps. For example, you might trigger the workflow when a new work item is created and then perform an update or notification action.

3. **Specify Details**: For any of the above options, you'll need to specify the project, repository, or work item details relevant to your use case.

1. **Extend the Current Workflow**: You can add a new node for ADO to your existing workflow. For example, you could create a node that updates a work item in ADO when a Jira issue is created.

2. **New Workflow with ADO**: If you prefer to start fresh, you can create a new workflow that includes an ADO action. You might want to use actions like `update_work_item` or `create_work_item` based on your needs.

3. **Specify Details**: If you decide to extend the current workflow, make sure to specify the repository and update type for the ADO node, similar to how it's done for GitHub and Bitbucket.

agent: It looks like you want to add Azure DevOps (ADO) to your workflow. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Extend the Current Workflow**: You can add a new node for ADO to your existing workflow. For example, you could create a node that updates a work item in ADO when a Jira issue is created.

2. **New Workflow with ADO**: If you prefer to start fresh, you can create a new workflow that includes an ADO action. You might want to use actions like `update_work_item` or `create_work_item` based on your needs.

3. **Specify Details**: If you decide to extend the current workflow, make sure to specify the repository and update type for the ADO node, similar to how it's done for GitHub and Bitbucket.

Let me know if you need help with the specifics of adding ADO to your workflow! How would you like to proceed?

agent: It looks like you want to add Azure DevOps (ADO) to your workflow. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Extend the Current Workflow**: You can add a new node for ADO to your existing workflow. For example, you could create a node that updates a work item in ADO when a Jira issue is created.

2. **New Workflow with ADO**: If you prefer to start fresh, you can create a new workflow that includes an ADO action. You might want to use actions like `update_work_item` or `create_work_item` based on your needs.

3. **Specify Details**: If you decide to extend the current workflow, make sure to specify the repository and update type for the ADO node, similar to how it's done for GitHub and Bitbucket.

Let me know if you need help with the specifics of adding ADO to your workflow! How would you like to proceed?
agent: To modify the workflow by adding Azure DevOps (ADO), you have a couple of options:

1. **Extend the Current Workflow**: Add a new node specifically for ADO to your existing workflow. For instance, you could create a node that updates or creates a work item in ADO when a Jira issue is created. Specify the necessary details such as the project and work item type.

2. **New Workflow with ADO**: If you prefer to start fresh, you can create a new workflow that includes an ADO action. Consider actions like `update_work_item` or `create_work_item` based on your requirements.

3. **Specify Details for ADO Node**: If you're extending the current workflow, ensure you specify the project and work item type for the ADO node, similar to how it's done for GitHub and Bitbucket nodes.

agent: To extend your current workflow by adding Azure DevOps (ADO), you can follow these steps:

1. **Add ADO Node**: Introduce a new node in your existing workflow for ADO. This node can perform actions like `update_work_item` or `create_work_item` when a Jira issue is created.

2. **Specify ADO Details**: Make sure to specify the project and work item type for the ADO node, similar to how you've specified details for GitHub and Bitbucket nodes.

3. **Connect Nodes**: Ensure that the new ADO node is properly connected to the existing nodes in your workflow to maintain the logical flow.

If you prefer to start a new workflow, you can create one that includes ADO actions from scratch. Let me know if you need further assistance with the specifics of adding ADO to your workflow! How would you like to proceed?

agent: It looks like you want to add Azure DevOps (ADO) to your workflow. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Extend the Current Workflow**: You can add a new node for ADO to your existing workflow. For example, you could create a node that updates a work item in ADO when a Jira issue is created.

2. **New Workflow with ADO**: If you prefer to start fresh, you can create a new workflow that includes an ADO action. You might want to use actions like `update_work_item` or `create_work_item` based on your needs.

3. **Specify Details**: If you decide to extend the current workflow, make sure to specify the repository and update type for the ADO node, similar to how it's done for GitHub and Bitbucket.

Let me know if you need help with the specifics of adding ADO to your workflow! How would you like to proceed?

agent: It looks like you want to add Azure DevOps (ADO) to your workflow. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Extend the Current Workflow**: You can add a new node for ADO to your existing workflow. For example, you could create a node that updates a work item in ADO when a Jira issue is created.

2. **New Workflow with ADO**: If you prefer to start fresh, you can create a new workflow that includes an ADO action. You might want to use actions like `update_work_item` or `create_work_item` based on your needs.

3. **Specify Details**: If you decide to extend the current workflow, make sure to specify the repository and update type for the ADO node, similar to how it's done for GitHub and Bitbucket.

Let me know if you need help with the specifics of adding ADO to your workflow! How would you like to proceed?
agent: To modify the workflow by adding Azure DevOps (ADO), you have a couple of options:

1. **Extend the Current Workflow**: Add a new node specifically for ADO to your existing workflow. For instance, you could create a node that updates or creates a work item in ADO when a Jira issue is created. Specify the necessary details such as the project and work item type.

2. **New Workflow with ADO**: If you prefer to start fresh, you can create a new workflow that includes an ADO action. Consider actions like `update_work_item` or `create_work_item` based on your requirements.

3. **Specify Details for ADO Node**: If you're extending the current workflow, ensure you specify the project and work item type for the ADO node, similar to how it's done for GitHub and Bitbucket nodes.

Let me know if you need further assistance with the specifics of adding ADO to your workflow! How would you like to proceed?
agent: To extend your current workflow by adding Azure DevOps (ADO), you can follow these steps:

1. **Add ADO Node**: Introduce a new node in your existing workflow for ADO. This node can perform actions like `update_work_item` or `create_work_item` when a Jira issue is created.

2. **Specify ADO Details**: Make sure to specify the project and work item type for the ADO node, similar to how you've specified details for GitHub and Bitbucket nodes.

3. **Connect Nodes**: Ensure that the new ADO node is properly connected to the existing nodes in your workflow to maintain the logical flow.

If you prefer to start a new workflow, you can create one that includes ADO actions from scratch. Let me know if you need further assistance with the specifics of adding ADO to your workflow! How would you like to proceed?

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) typically include platforms like GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, and Azure DevOps. These platforms allow for version control, collaboration, and management of code repositories.

If you're considering integrating any of these providers into a workflow, you might want to include actions such as creating or updating repositories, managing branches, or automating deployments. For example, in a workflow, you could trigger actions based on events like code commits, pull requests, or issue creation.

If you need help designing a specific workflow with these providers, feel free to ask for more details!

agent: It looks like you want to add Azure DevOps (ADO) to your workflow. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Extend the Current Workflow**: You can add a new node for ADO to your existing workflow. For example, you could create a node that updates a work item in ADO when a Jira issue is created.

2. **New Workflow with ADO**: If you prefer to start fresh, you can create a new workflow that includes an ADO action. You might want to use actions like `update_work_item` or `create_work_item` based on your needs.

3. **Specify Details**: If you decide to extend the current workflow, make sure to specify the repository and update type for the ADO node, similar to how it's done for GitHub and Bitbucket.

Let me know if you need help with the specifics of adding ADO to your workflow! How would you like to proceed?
agent: To modify the workflow by adding Azure DevOps (ADO), you have a couple of options:

1. **Extend the Current Workflow**: Add a new node specifically for ADO to your existing workflow. For instance, you could create a node that updates or creates a work item in ADO when a Jira issue is created. Specify the necessary details such as the project and work item type.

2. **New Workflow with ADO**: If you prefer to start fresh, you can create a new workflow that includes an ADO action. Consider actions like `update_work_item` or `create_work_item` based on your requirements.

3. **Specify Details for ADO Node**: If you're extending the current workflow, ensure you specify the project and work item type for the ADO node, similar to how it's done for GitHub and Bitbucket nodes.

Let me know if you need further assistance with the specifics of adding ADO to your workflow! How would you like to proceed?
agent: To extend your current workflow by adding Azure DevOps (ADO), you can follow these steps:

1. **Add ADO Node**: Introduce a new node in your existing workflow for ADO. This node can perform actions like `update_work_item` or `create_work_item` when a Jira issue is created.

2. **Specify ADO Details**: Make sure to specify the project and work item type for the ADO node, similar to how you've specified details for GitHub and Bitbucket nodes.

3. **Connect Nodes**: Ensure that the new ADO node is properly connected to the existing nodes in your workflow to maintain the logical flow.

If you prefer to start a new workflow, you can create one that includes ADO actions from scratch. Let me know if you need further assistance with the specifics of adding ADO to your workflow! How would you like to proceed?

agent: It looks like you want to add Azure DevOps (ADO) to your workflow. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Extend the Current Workflow**: You can add a new node for ADO to your existing workflow. For example, you could create a node that updates a work item in ADO when a Jira issue is created.

2. **New Workflow with ADO**: If you prefer to start fresh, you can create a new workflow that includes an ADO action. You might want to use actions like `update_work_item` or `create_work_item` based on your needs.

3. **Specify Details**: If you decide to extend the current workflow, make sure to specify the repository and update type for the ADO node, similar to how it's done for GitHub and Bitbucket.

Let me know if you need help with the specifics of adding ADO to your workflow! How would you like to proceed?
agent: To modify the workflow by adding Azure DevOps (ADO), you have a couple of options:

1. **Extend the Current Workflow**: Add a new node specifically for ADO to your existing workflow. For instance, you could create a node that updates or creates a work item in ADO when a Jira issue is created. Specify the necessary details such as the project and work item type.

2. **New Workflow with ADO**: If you prefer to start fresh, you can create a new workflow that includes an ADO action. Consider actions like `update_work_item` or `create_work_item` based on your requirements.

3. **Specify Details for ADO Node**: If you're extending the current workflow, ensure you specify the project and work item type for the ADO node, similar to how it's done for GitHub and Bitbucket nodes.

Let me know if you need further assistance with the specifics of adding ADO to your workflow! How would you like to proceed?
agent: To extend your current workflow by adding Azure DevOps (ADO), you can follow these steps:

1. **Add ADO Node**: Introduce a new node in your existing workflow for ADO. This node can perform actions like `update_work_item` or `create_work_item` when a Jira issue is created.

2. **Specify ADO Details**: Make sure to specify the project and work item type for the ADO node, similar to how you've specified details for GitHub and Bitbucket nodes.

3. **Connect Nodes**: Ensure that the new ADO node is properly connected to the existing nodes in your workflow to maintain the logical flow.

If you prefer to start a new workflow, you can create one that includes ADO actions from scratch. Let me know if you need further assistance with the specifics of adding ADO to your workflow! How would you like to proceed?

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) typically include platforms like GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, and Azure DevOps. These platforms allow for version control, collaboration, and management of code repositories.

If you're considering integrating any of these providers into a workflow, you might want to include actions such as creating or updating repositories, managing branches, or automating deployments. For example, in a workflow, you could trigger actions based on events like code commits, pull requests, or issue creation.

2025-03-21 12:27:35,300 - INFO - General response: In Azure DevOps (ADO), there are several actions you can perform, such as:

1. **Build and Release Pipelines**: Automate your build and release processes.
2. **Work Item Management**: Create, update, and manage work items like user stories, tasks, and bugs.
3. **Version Control**: Use Git repositories to manage your code.
4. **Test Management**: Plan, execute, and track tests.
5. **Extensions**: Integrate with various tools and services through extensions.

If you are considering using ADO in your workflow, you might want to include actions such as triggering a build pipeline or updating a work item based on specific conditions. If you have specific actions in mind, I can help you integrate them into your existing workflow.

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers integrated into your workflow include GitHub, Bitbucket, and ADO. These are set up as actions within your workflow, allowing you to update repositories based on conditions you define. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers integrated into your workflow include GitHub, Bitbucket, and ADO. These are set up as actions within your workflow, allowing you to update repositories based on conditions you define. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers are integrated into your workflow as follows:

1. **GitHub**: This is set up as an SCM action in your workflow, allowing you to perform updates on GitHub repositories.

2. **Bitbucket**: Similar to GitHub, Bitbucket is also integrated as an SCM action, enabling updates to Bitbucket repositories.

3. **ADO (Azure DevOps)**: Recently added to your workflow, ADO provides another option for managing and updating your repositories.

These providers are designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, allowing you to automate and manage your code updates efficiently. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers are integrated into your workflow as follows:

1. **GitHub**: This is set up as an SCM action in your workflow, allowing you to perform updates on GitHub repositories.

2. **Bitbucket**: Similar to GitHub, Bitbucket is also integrated as an SCM action, enabling updates to Bitbucket repositories.

3. **ADO (Azure DevOps)**: Recently added to your workflow, ADO provides another option for managing and updating your repositories.

These providers are designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, allowing you to automate and manage your code updates efficiently. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers are integrated into your workflow as follows:

1. **GitHub**: This is set up as an SCM action in your workflow, allowing you to perform updates on GitHub repositories.

2. **Bitbucket**: Similar to GitHub, Bitbucket is also integrated as an SCM action, enabling updates to Bitbucket repositories.

3. **ADO (Azure DevOps)**: Recently added to your workflow, ADO provides another option for managing and updating your repositories.

These providers are designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, allowing you to automate and manage your code updates efficiently. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.

These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers are integrated into your workflow as follows:

1. **GitHub**: This is set up as an SCM action in your workflow, allowing you to perform updates on GitHub repositories.

2. **Bitbucket**: Similar to GitHub, Bitbucket is also integrated as an SCM action, enabling updates to Bitbucket repositories.

3. **ADO (Azure DevOps)**: Recently added to your workflow, ADO provides another option for managing and updating your repositories.

These providers are designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, allowing you to automate and manage your code updates efficiently. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers are integrated into your workflow as follows:

1. **GitHub**: This is set up as an SCM action in your workflow, allowing you to perform updates on GitHub repositories.

2. **Bitbucket**: Similar to GitHub, Bitbucket is also integrated as an SCM action, enabling updates to Bitbucket repositories.

3. **ADO (Azure DevOps)**: Recently added to your workflow, ADO provides another option for managing and updating your repositories.

These providers are designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, allowing you to automate and manage your code updates efficiently. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask!

These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base.

If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers are integrated into your workflow as follows:

1. **GitHub**: This is set up as an SCM action in your workflow, allowing you to perform updates on GitHub repositories.

2. **Bitbucket**: Similar to GitHub, Bitbucket is also integrated as an SCM action, enabling updates to Bitbucket repositories.

3. **ADO (Azure DevOps)**: Recently added to your workflow, ADO provides another option for managing and updating your repositories.

These providers are designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, allowing you to automate and manage your code updates efficiently. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers are integrated into your workflow as follows:

1. **GitHub**: This is set up as an SCM action in your workflow, allowing you to perform updates on GitHub repositories.

2. **Bitbucket**: Similar to GitHub, Bitbucket is also integrated as an SCM action, enabling updates to Bitbucket repositories.

3. **ADO (Azure DevOps)**: Recently added to your workflow, ADO provides another option for managing and updating your repositories.

These providers are designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, allowing you to automate and manage your code updates efficiently. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers are integrated into your workflow as follows:

1. **GitHub**: This is set up as an SCM action in your workflow, allowing you to perform updates on GitHub repositories.

2. **Bitbucket**: Similar to GitHub, Bitbucket is also integrated as an SCM action, enabling updates to Bitbucket repositories.

3. **ADO (Azure DevOps)**: Recently added to your workflow, ADO provides another option for managing and updating your repositories.

These providers are designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, allowing you to automate and manage your code updates efficiently. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers are integrated into your workflow as follows:

1. **GitHub**: This is set up as an SCM action in your workflow, allowing you to perform updates on GitHub repositories.

2. **Bitbucket**: Similar to GitHub, Bitbucket is also integrated as an SCM action, enabling updates to Bitbucket repositories.

3. **ADO (Azure DevOps)**: Recently added to your workflow, ADO provides another option for managing and updating your repositories.

These providers are designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, allowing you to automate and manage your code updates efficiently. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.'

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers are integrated into your workflow as follows:

1. **GitHub**: This is set up as an SCM action in your workflow, allowing you to perform updates on GitHub repositories.

2. **Bitbucket**: Similar to GitHub, Bitbucket is also integrated as an SCM action, enabling updates to Bitbucket repositories.

3. **ADO (Azure DevOps)**: Recently added to your workflow, ADO provides another option for managing and updating your repositories.

These providers are designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, allowing you to automate and manage your code updates efficiently. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers are integrated into your workflow as follows:

1. **GitHub**: This is set up as an SCM action in your workflow, allowing you to perform updates on GitHub repositories.

2. **Bitbucket**: Similar to GitHub, Bitbucket is also integrated as an SCM action, enabling updates to Bitbucket repositories.

3. **ADO (Azure DevOps)**: Recently added to your workflow, ADO provides another option for managing and updating your repositories.

These providers are designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, allowing you to automate and manage your code updates efficiently. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers are integrated into your workflow as follows:

1. **GitHub**: This is set up as an SCM action in your workflow, allowing you to perform updates on GitHub repositories.

2. **Bitbucket**: Similar to GitHub, Bitbucket is also integrated as an SCM action, enabling updates to Bitbucket repositories.

3. **ADO (Azure DevOps)**: Recently added to your workflow, ADO provides another option for managing and updating your repositories.

These providers are designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, allowing you to automate and manage your code updates efficiently. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers are integrated into your workflow as follows:

1. **GitHub**: This is set up as an SCM action in your workflow, allowing you to perform updates on GitHub repositories.

2. **Bitbucket**: Similar to GitHub, Bitbucket is also integrated as an SCM action, enabling updates to Bitbucket repositories.

3. **ADO (Azure DevOps)**: Recently added to your workflow, ADO provides another option for managing and updating your repositories.

These providers are designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, allowing you to automate and manage your code updates efficiently. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.

2025-03-21 15:59:55,090 - INFO - Unclear intent response: Based on your workflow setup, you have integrated Jira as a trigger and have actions for updating GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitHub Enterprise. To decide which Source Code Management (SCM) provider to update, you need to define a specific condition in the "condition-check" node. Here are some suggestions for setting up this condition:

1. **Repository Name or ID**: Use the repository name or ID to determine which SCM provider to update. For example, if the repository name contains "github", update GitHub; if it contains "bitbucket", update Bitbucket.

2. **Issue Type or Label**: Use specific Jira issue types or labels to decide the update path. For instance, if an issue is labeled "GitHub", direct the update to GitHub.

3. **Custom Field in Jira**: Utilize a custom field in your Jira issues that specifies the target SCM provider. This field can be checked in your condition node to route the update accordingly.

4. **Priority or Status**: Use the priority or status of the Jira issue to determine the update path. For example, high-priority issues might be updated in GitHub, while others go to Bitbucket.

If you need help implementing any of these conditions or have other criteria in mind, feel free to ask for more detailed guidance!

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers are integrated into your workflow as follows:

1. **GitHub**: This is set up as an SCM action in your workflow, allowing you to perform updates on GitHub repositories.

2. **Bitbucket**: Similar to GitHub, Bitbucket is also integrated as an SCM action, enabling updates to Bitbucket repositories.

3. **ADO (Azure DevOps)**: Recently added to your workflow, ADO provides another option for managing and updating your repositories.

These providers are designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, allowing you to automate and manage your code updates efficiently. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.

  "question": "What is the specific condition to decide between updating GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitHub Enterprise?"
}. Anything else to add?
agent: Based on your workflow setup, you have integrated Jira as a trigger and have actions for updating GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitHub Enterprise. To decide which Source Code Management (SCM) provider to update, you need to define a specific condition in the "condition-check" node. Here are some suggestions for setting up this condition:

1. **Repository Name or ID**: Use the repository name or ID to determine which SCM provider to update. For example, if the repository name contains "github", update GitHub; if it contains "bitbucket", update Bitbucket.

2. **Issue Type or Label**: Use specific Jira issue types or labels to decide the update path. For instance, if an issue is labeled "GitHub", direct the update to GitHub.

3. **Custom Field in Jira**: Utilize a custom field in your Jira issues that specifies the target SCM provider. This field can be checked in your condition node to route the update accordingly.

4. **Priority or Status**: Use the priority or status of the Jira issue to determine the update path. For example, high-priority issues might be updated in GitHub, while others go to Bitbucket.

If you need help implementing any of these conditions or have other criteria in mind, feel free to ask for more detailed guidance! How would you like to proceed?

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow.

  "question": "What is the specific condition to decide between updating GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitHub Enterprise?"
}. Anything else to add?
agent: Based on your workflow setup, you have integrated Jira as a trigger and have actions for updating GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitHub Enterprise. To decide which Source Code Management (SCM) provider to update, you need to define a specific condition in the "condition-check" node. Here are some suggestions for setting up this condition:

1. **Repository Name or ID**: Use the repository name or ID to determine which SCM provider to update. For example, if the repository name contains "github", update GitHub; if it contains "bitbucket", update Bitbucket.

2. **Issue Type or Label**: Use specific Jira issue types or labels to decide the update path. For instance, if an issue is labeled "GitHub", direct the update to GitHub.

3. **Custom Field in Jira**: Utilize a custom field in your Jira issues that specifies the target SCM provider. This field can be checked in your condition node to route the update accordingly.

4. **Priority or Status**: Use the priority or status of the Jira issue to determine the update path. For example, high-priority issues might be updated in GitHub, while others go to Bitbucket.

If you need help implementing any of these conditions or have other criteria in mind, feel free to ask for more detailed guidance! How would you like to proceed?

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers are integrated into your workflow as follows:

1. **GitHub**: This is set up as an SCM action in your workflow, allowing you to perform updates on GitHub repositories.

2. **Bitbucket**: Similar to GitHub, Bitbucket is also integrated as an SCM action, enabling updates to Bitbucket repositories.

3. **ADO (Azure DevOps)**: Recently added to your workflow, ADO provides another option for managing and updating your repositories.

These providers are designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, allowing you to automate and manage your code updates efficiently. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.

  "question": "What is the specific condition to decide between updating GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitHub Enterprise?"
}. Anything else to add?
agent: Based on your workflow setup, you have integrated Jira as a trigger and have actions for updating GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitHub Enterprise. To decide which Source Code Management (SCM) provider to update, you need to define a specific condition in the "condition-check" node. Here are some suggestions for setting up this condition:

1. **Repository Name or ID**: Use the repository name or ID to determine which SCM provider to update. For example, if the repository name contains "github", update GitHub; if it contains "bitbucket", update Bitbucket.

2. **Issue Type or Label**: Use specific Jira issue types or labels to decide the update path. For instance, if an issue is labeled "GitHub", direct the update to GitHub.

3. **Custom Field in Jira**: Utilize a custom field in your Jira issues that specifies the target SCM provider. This field can be checked in your condition node to route the update accordingly.

4. **Priority or Status**: Use the priority or status of the Jira issue to determine the update path. For example, high-priority issues might be updated in GitHub, while others go to Bitbucket.

If you need help implementing any of these conditions or have other criteria in mind, feel free to ask for more detailed guidance! How would you like to proceed?

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers are integrated into your workflow as follows:

1. **GitHub**: This is set up as an SCM action in your workflow, allowing you to perform updates on GitHub repositories.

2. **Bitbucket**: Similar to GitHub, Bitbucket is also integrated as an SCM action, enabling updates to Bitbucket repositories.

3. **ADO (Azure DevOps)**: Recently added to your workflow, ADO provides another option for managing and updating your repositories.

These providers are designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, allowing you to automate and manage your code updates efficiently. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.

  "question": "What is the specific condition to decide between updating GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitHub Enterprise?"
}. Anything else to add?
agent: Based on your workflow setup, you have integrated Jira as a trigger and have actions for updating GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitHub Enterprise. To decide which Source Code Management (SCM) provider to update, you need to define a specific condition in the "condition-check" node. Here are some suggestions for setting up this condition:

1. **Repository Name or ID**: Use the repository name or ID to determine which SCM provider to update. For example, if the repository name contains "github", update GitHub; if it contains "bitbucket", update Bitbucket.

2. **Issue Type or Label**: Use specific Jira issue types or labels to decide the update path. For instance, if an issue is labeled "GitHub", direct the update to GitHub.

3. **Custom Field in Jira**: Utilize a custom field in your Jira issues that specifies the target SCM provider. This field can be checked in your condition node to route the update accordingly.

4. **Priority or Status**: Use the priority or status of the Jira issue to determine the update path. For example, high-priority issues might be updated in GitHub, while others go to Bitbucket.

If you need help implementing any of these conditions or have other criteria in mind, feel free to ask for more detailed guidance! How would you like to proceed?

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers are integrated into your workflow as follows:

1. **GitHub**: This is set up as an SCM action in your workflow, allowing you to perform updates on GitHub repositories.

2. **Bitbucket**: Similar to GitHub, Bitbucket is also integrated as an SCM action, enabling updates to Bitbucket repositories.

3. **ADO (Azure DevOps)**: Recently added to your workflow, ADO provides another option for managing and updating your repositories.

These providers are designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, allowing you to automate and manage your code updates efficiently. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.

  "question": "What is the specific condition to decide between updating GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitHub Enterprise?"
}. Anything else to add?
agent: Based on your workflow setup, you have integrated Jira as a trigger and have actions for updating GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitHub Enterprise. To decide which Source Code Management (SCM) provider to update, you need to define a specific condition in the "condition-check" node. Here are some suggestions for setting up this condition:

1. **Repository Name or ID**: Use the repository name or ID to determine which SCM provider to update. For example, if the repository name contains "github", update GitHub; if it contains "bitbucket", update Bitbucket.

2. **Issue Type or Label**: Use specific Jira issue types or labels to decide the update path. For instance, if an issue is labeled "GitHub", direct the update to GitHub.

3. **Custom Field in Jira**: Utilize a custom field in your Jira issues that specifies the target SCM provider. This field can be checked in your condition node to route the update accordingly.

4. **Priority or Status**: Use the priority or status of the Jira issue to determine the update path. For example, high-priority issues might be updated in GitHub, while others go to Bitbucket.

If you need help implementing any of these conditions or have other criteria in mind, feel free to ask for more detailed guidance! How would you like to proceed?

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers are integrated into your workflow as follows:

1. **GitHub**: This is set up as an SCM action in your workflow, allowing you to perform updates on GitHub repositories.

2. **Bitbucket**: Similar to GitHub, Bitbucket is also integrated as an SCM action, enabling updates to Bitbucket repositories.

3. **ADO (Azure DevOps)**: Recently added to your workflow, ADO provides another option for managing and updating your repositories.

These providers are designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, allowing you to automate and manage your code updates efficiently. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.

  "question": "What is the specific condition to decide between updating GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitHub Enterprise?"
}. Anything else to add?
agent: Based on your workflow setup, you have integrated Jira as a trigger and have actions for updating GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitHub Enterprise. To decide which Source Code Management (SCM) provider to update, you need to define a specific condition in the "condition-check" node. Here are some suggestions for setting up this condition:

1. **Repository Name or ID**: Use the repository name or ID to determine which SCM provider to update. For example, if the repository name contains "github", update GitHub; if it contains "bitbucket", update Bitbucket.

2. **Issue Type or Label**: Use specific Jira issue types or labels to decide the update path. For instance, if an issue is labeled "GitHub", direct the update to GitHub.

3. **Custom Field in Jira**: Utilize a custom field in your Jira issues that specifies the target SCM provider. This field can be checked in your condition node to route the update accordingly.

4. **Priority or Status**: Use the priority or status of the Jira issue to determine the update path. For example, high-priority issues might be updated in GitHub, while others go to Bitbucket.

If you need help implementing any of these conditions or have other criteria in mind, feel free to ask for more detailed guidance! How would you like to proceed?

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers are integrated into your workflow as follows:

1. **GitHub**: This is set up as an SCM action in your workflow, allowing you to perform updates on GitHub repositories.

2. **Bitbucket**: Similar to GitHub, Bitbucket is also integrated as an SCM action, enabling updates to Bitbucket repositories.

3. **ADO (Azure DevOps)**: Recently added to your workflow, ADO provides another option for managing and updating your repositories.

These providers are designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, allowing you to automate and manage your code updates efficiently. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.

  "question": "What is the specific condition to decide between updating GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitHub Enterprise?"
}. Anything else to add?
agent: Based on your workflow setup, you have integrated Jira as a trigger and have actions for updating GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitHub Enterprise. To decide which Source Code Management (SCM) provider to update, you need to define a specific condition in the "condition-check" node. Here are some suggestions for setting up this condition:

1. **Repository Name or ID**: Use the repository name or ID to determine which SCM provider to update. For example, if the repository name contains "github", update GitHub; if it contains "bitbucket", update Bitbucket.

2. **Issue Type or Label**: Use specific Jira issue types or labels to decide the update path. For instance, if an issue is labeled "GitHub", direct the update to GitHub.

3. **Custom Field in Jira**: Utilize a custom field in your Jira issues that specifies the target SCM provider. This field can be checked in your condition node to route the update accordingly.

4. **Priority or Status**: Use the priority or status of the Jira issue to determine the update path. For example, high-priority issues might be updated in GitHub, while others go to Bitbucket.

If you need help implementing any of these conditions or have other criteria in mind, feel free to ask for more detailed guidance! How would you like to proceed?

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers are integrated into your workflow as follows:

1. **GitHub**: This is set up as an SCM action in your workflow, allowing you to perform updates on GitHub repositories.

2. **Bitbucket**: Similar to GitHub, Bitbucket is also integrated as an SCM action, enabling updates to Bitbucket repositories.

3. **ADO (Azure DevOps)**: Recently added to your workflow, ADO provides another option for managing and updating your repositories.

These providers are designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, allowing you to automate and manage your code updates efficiently. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.

  "question": "What is the specific condition to decide between updating GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitHub Enterprise?"
}. Anything else to add?
agent: Based on your workflow setup, you have integrated Jira as a trigger and have actions for updating GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitHub Enterprise. To decide which Source Code Management (SCM) provider to update, you need to define a specific condition in the "condition-check" node. Here are some suggestions for setting up this condition:

1. **Repository Name or ID**: Use the repository name or ID to determine which SCM provider to update. For example, if the repository name contains "github", update GitHub; if it contains "bitbucket", update Bitbucket.

2. **Issue Type or Label**: Use specific Jira issue types or labels to decide the update path. For instance, if an issue is labeled "GitHub", direct the update to GitHub.

3. **Custom Field in Jira**: Utilize a custom field in your Jira issues that specifies the target SCM provider. This field can be checked in your condition node to route the update accordingly.

4. **Priority or Status**: Use the priority or status of the Jira issue to determine the update path. For example, high-priority issues might be updated in GitHub, while others go to Bitbucket.

If you need help implementing any of these conditions or have other criteria in mind, feel free to ask for more detailed guidance! How would you like to proceed?

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: Based on your workflow setup, you have integrated Jira as a trigger and have actions for updating GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitHub Enterprise. To decide which Source Code Management (SCM) provider to update, you need to define a specific condition in the "condition-check" node. Here are some suggestions for setting up this condition:

1. **Repository Name or ID**: Use the repository name or ID to determine which SCM provider to update. For example, if the repository name contains "github", update GitHub; if it contains "bitbucket", update Bitbucket.

2. **Issue Type or Label**: Use specific Jira issue types or labels to decide the update path. For instance, if an issue is labeled "GitHub", direct the update to GitHub.

3. **Custom Field in Jira**: Utilize a custom field in your Jira issues that specifies the target SCM provider. This field can be checked in your condition node to route the update accordingly.

4. **Priority or Status**: Use the priority or status of the Jira issue to determine the update path. For example, high-priority issues might be updated in GitHub, while others go to Bitbucket.

If you need help implementing any of these conditions or have other criteria in mind, feel free to ask for more detailed guidance! How would you like to proceed?

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers are integrated into your workflow as follows:

1. **GitHub**: This is set up as an SCM action in your workflow, allowing you to perform updates on GitHub repositories.

2. **Bitbucket**: Similar to GitHub, Bitbucket is also integrated as an SCM action, enabling updates to Bitbucket repositories.

3. **ADO (Azure DevOps)**: Recently added to your workflow, ADO provides another option for managing and updating your repositories.

These providers are designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, allowing you to automate and manage your code updates efficiently. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.

  "question": "What is the specific condition to decide between updating GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitHub Enterprise?"
}. Anything else to add?
agent: Based on your workflow setup, you have integrated Jira as a trigger and have actions for updating GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitHub Enterprise. To decide which Source Code Management (SCM) provider to update, you need to define a specific condition in the "condition-check" node. Here are some suggestions for setting up this condition:

1. **Repository Name or ID**: Use the repository name or ID to determine which SCM provider to update. For example, if the repository name contains "github", update GitHub; if it contains "bitbucket", update Bitbucket.

2. **Issue Type or Label**: Use specific Jira issue types or labels to decide the update path. For instance, if an issue is labeled "GitHub", direct the update to GitHub.

3. **Custom Field in Jira**: Utilize a custom field in your Jira issues that specifies the target SCM provider. This field can be checked in your condition node to route the update accordingly.

4. **Priority or Status**: Use the priority or status of the Jira issue to determine the update path. For example, high-priority issues might be updated in GitHub, while others go to Bitbucket.

If you need help implementing any of these conditions or have other criteria in mind, feel free to ask for more detailed guidance! How would you like to proceed?

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow.

  "question": "What is the specific condition to decide between updating GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitHub Enterprise?"
}. Anything else to add?
agent: Based on your workflow setup, you have integrated Jira as a trigger and have actions for updating GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitHub Enterprise. To decide which Source Code Management (SCM) provider to update, you need to define a specific condition in the "condition-check" node. Here are some suggestions for setting up this condition:

1. **Repository Name or ID**: Use the repository name or ID to determine which SCM provider to update. For example, if the repository name contains "github", update GitHub; if it contains "bitbucket", update Bitbucket.

2. **Issue Type or Label**: Use specific Jira issue types or labels to decide the update path. For instance, if an issue is labeled "GitHub", direct the update to GitHub.

3. **Custom Field in Jira**: Utilize a custom field in your Jira issues that specifies the target SCM provider. This field can be checked in your condition node to route the update accordingly.

4. **Priority or Status**: Use the priority or status of the Jira issue to determine the update path. For example, high-priority issues might be updated in GitHub, while others go to Bitbucket.

If you need help implementing any of these conditions or have other criteria in mind, feel free to ask for more detailed guidance! How would you like to proceed?

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers are integrated into your workflow as follows:

1. **GitHub**: This is set up as an SCM action in your workflow, allowing you to perform updates on GitHub repositories.

2. **Bitbucket**: Similar to GitHub, Bitbucket is also integrated as an SCM action, enabling updates to Bitbucket repositories.

3. **ADO (Azure DevOps)**: Recently added to your workflow, ADO provides another option for managing and updating your repositories.

These providers are designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, allowing you to automate and manage your code updates efficiently. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.

  "question": "What is the specific condition to decide between updating GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitHub Enterprise?"
}. Anything else to add?
agent: Based on your workflow setup, you have integrated Jira as a trigger and have actions for updating GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitHub Enterprise. To decide which Source Code Management (SCM) provider to update, you need to define a specific condition in the "condition-check" node. Here are some suggestions for setting up this condition:

1. **Repository Name or ID**: Use the repository name or ID to determine which SCM provider to update. For example, if the repository name contains "github", update GitHub; if it contains "bitbucket", update Bitbucket.

2. **Issue Type or Label**: Use specific Jira issue types or labels to decide the update path. For instance, if an issue is labeled "GitHub", direct the update to GitHub.

3. **Custom Field in Jira**: Utilize a custom field in your Jira issues that specifies the target SCM provider. This field can be checked in your condition node to route the update accordingly.

4. **Priority or Status**: Use the priority or status of the Jira issue to determine the update path. For example, high-priority issues might be updated in GitHub, while others go to Bitbucket.

If you need help implementing any of these conditions or have other criteria in mind, feel free to ask for more detailed guidance! How would you like to proceed?

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers are integrated into your workflow as follows:

1. **GitHub**: This is set up as an SCM action in your workflow, allowing you to perform updates on GitHub repositories.

2. **Bitbucket**: Similar to GitHub, Bitbucket is also integrated as an SCM action, enabling updates to Bitbucket repositories.

3. **ADO (Azure DevOps)**: Recently added to your workflow, ADO provides another option for managing and updating your repositories.

These providers are designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, allowing you to automate and manage your code updates efficiently. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.

  "question": "What is the specific condition to decide between updating GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitHub Enterprise?"
}. Anything else to add?
agent: Based on your workflow setup, you have integrated Jira as a trigger and have actions for updating GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitHub Enterprise. To decide which Source Code Management (SCM) provider to update, you need to define a specific condition in the "condition-check" node. Here are some suggestions for setting up this condition:

1. **Repository Name or ID**: Use the repository name or ID to determine which SCM provider to update. For example, if the repository name contains "github", update GitHub; if it contains "bitbucket", update Bitbucket.

2. **Issue Type or Label**: Use specific Jira issue types or labels to decide the update path. For instance, if an issue is labeled "GitHub", direct the update to GitHub.

3. **Custom Field in Jira**: Utilize a custom field in your Jira issues that specifies the target SCM provider. This field can be checked in your condition node to route the update accordingly.

4. **Priority or Status**: Use the priority or status of the Jira issue to determine the update path. For example, high-priority issues might be updated in GitHub, while others go to Bitbucket.

If you need help implementing any of these conditions or have other criteria in mind, feel free to ask for more detailed guidance! How would you like to proceed?

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers are integrated into your workflow as follows:

1. **GitHub**: This is set up as an SCM action in your workflow, allowing you to perform updates on GitHub repositories.

2. **Bitbucket**: Similar to GitHub, Bitbucket is also integrated as an SCM action, enabling updates to Bitbucket repositories.

3. **ADO (Azure DevOps)**: Recently added to your workflow, ADO provides another option for managing and updating your repositories.

These providers are designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, allowing you to automate and manage your code updates efficiently. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.

  "question": "What is the specific condition to decide between updating GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitHub Enterprise?"
}. Anything else to add?
agent: Based on your workflow setup, you have integrated Jira as a trigger and have actions for updating GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitHub Enterprise. To decide which Source Code Management (SCM) provider to update, you need to define a specific condition in the "condition-check" node. Here are some suggestions for setting up this condition:

1. **Repository Name or ID**: Use the repository name or ID to determine which SCM provider to update. For example, if the repository name contains "github", update GitHub; if it contains "bitbucket", update Bitbucket.

2. **Issue Type or Label**: Use specific Jira issue types or labels to decide the update path. For instance, if an issue is labeled "GitHub", direct the update to GitHub.

3. **Custom Field in Jira**: Utilize a custom field in your Jira issues that specifies the target SCM provider. This field can be checked in your condition node to route the update accordingly.

4. **Priority or Status**: Use the priority or status of the Jira issue to determine the update path. For example, high-priority issues might be updated in GitHub, while others go to Bitbucket.

If you need help implementing any of these conditions or have other criteria in mind, feel free to ask for more detailed guidance! How would you like to proceed?

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

agent: In the context of Unizo's platform, the available Source Code Management (SCM) providers are integrated into your workflow as follows:

1. **GitHub**: This is set up as an SCM action in your workflow, allowing you to perform updates on GitHub repositories.

2. **Bitbucket**: Similar to GitHub, Bitbucket is also integrated as an SCM action, enabling updates to Bitbucket repositories.

3. **ADO (Azure DevOps)**: Recently added to your workflow, ADO provides another option for managing and updating your repositories.

These providers are designed to seamlessly integrate into your workflow, allowing you to automate and manage your code updates efficiently. If you're looking to expand your workflow with additional providers or need guidance on setting up specific conditions to decide between these options, feel free to ask! I'm here to help you optimize your workflow for seamless integration and efficiency.

  "question": "What is the specific condition to decide between updating GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitHub Enterprise?"
}. Anything else to add?
agent: Based on your workflow setup, you have integrated Jira as a trigger and have actions for updating GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitHub Enterprise. To decide which Source Code Management (SCM) provider to update, you need to define a specific condition in the "condition-check" node. Here are some suggestions for setting up this condition:

1. **Repository Name or ID**: Use the repository name or ID to determine which SCM provider to update. For example, if the repository name contains "github", update GitHub; if it contains "bitbucket", update Bitbucket.

2. **Issue Type or Label**: Use specific Jira issue types or labels to decide the update path. For instance, if an issue is labeled "GitHub", direct the update to GitHub.

3. **Custom Field in Jira**: Utilize a custom field in your Jira issues that specifies the target SCM provider. This field can be checked in your condition node to route the update accordingly.

4. **Priority or Status**: Use the priority or status of the Jira issue to determine the update path. For example, high-priority issues might be updated in GitHub, while others go to Bitbucket.

If you need help implementing any of these conditions or have other criteria in mind, feel free to ask for more detailed guidance! How would you like to proceed?

agent: The available providers for Source Code Management (SCM) in the context of your workflow are GitHub and Bitbucket. These are both integrated as actions in your workflow, with GitHub associated with the "github-update" node and Bitbucket with the "bitbucket-update" node. If you are considering other SCM providers or actions, it might be beneficial to include them in your workflow for a more comprehensive solution. If you need further assistance in setting up or modifying your workflow, feel free to ask!
agent: I'm sorry, but I don't have specific information about providers offered by "unizo" in the Pinecone knowledge base. If you have details about the actions or providers you are interested in, I can help suggest how to include them in a workflow. Alternatively, if you are looking for general information about integrating providers into a workflow, feel free to ask, and I can provide guidance on setting up or modifying workflows with the available tools and integrations.

  "question": "What is the specific condition to decide between updating GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitHub Enterprise?"
}. Anything else to add?
agent: Based on your workflow setup, you have integrated Jira as a trigger and have actions for updating GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitHub Enterprise. To decide which Source Code Management (SCM) provider to update, you need to define a specific condition in the "condition-check" node. Here are some suggestions for setting up this condition:

1. **Repository Name or ID**: Use the repository name or ID to determine which SCM provider to update. For example, if the repository name contains "github", update GitHub; if it contains "bitbucket", update Bitbucket.

2. **Issue Type or Label**: Use specific Jira issue types or labels to decide the update path. For instance, if an issue is labeled "GitHub", direct the update to GitHub.

3. **Custom Field in Jira**: Utilize a custom field in your Jira issues that specifies the target SCM provider. This field can be checked in your condition node to route the update accordingly.

4. **Priority or Status**: Use the priority or status of the Jira issue to determine the update path. For example, high-priority issues might be updated in GitHub, while others go to Bitbucket.

If you need help implementing any of these conditions or have other criteria in mind, feel free to ask for more detailed guidance! How would you like to proceed?

2025-03-25 06:56:31,280 - INFO - LLM plain text response: Hello Paul,

It seems like you have been working on creating and modifying a workflow for Jira and GitHub (now updated to GitHub Enterprise). Here are some next steps or suggestions you might consider:

1. **Review the Workflow**: Ensure that the updated workflow meets all your requirements. Check if the integration between Jira and GitHub Enterprise is functioning as expected.

2. **Test the Workflow**: Before deploying, test the workflow in a controlled environment to ensure that all actions (like creating Jira issues and GitHub Enterprise pull requests) are executed correctly.

3. **Add More Actions**: If needed, you can expand the workflow by adding more actions or connectors. For instance, you might want to include notifications, additional logic, or branching conditions.

4. **Documentation**: Document the workflow structure and its purpose for future reference or for other team members who might work with it.

5. **Seek Feedback**: If you are working in a team, get feedback from colleagues to see if there are any improvements or additional features that could be beneficial.

6. **Monitor and Maintain**: Once deployed, monitor the workflow for any issues and maintain it by updating components as needed.

If you have any specific questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
